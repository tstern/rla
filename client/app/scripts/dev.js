				"biography": "<b>Dekha Ibrahim Abdi was a global peacemaker from rural Kenya. She was engaged in peace work and conflict resolution in many of the world's most divided countries. Her comprehensive methodology combined grassroots activism, a soft but uncompromising leadership, and a spiritual motivation drawing on the teachings of Islam.</b><br /><br />\\r\\n<b>Dekha's early life</b><br />Dekha Abdi, born in Wajir in 1964, grew up in a mixed neighbourhood of different ethnic groups and religions. Although a Muslim, her closest childhood friends were Christian and of a different ethnic group. At secondary school, students were divided along religious and ethnic lines into two camps, but Dekha and her friends created a space between these opposing camps by sticking together; a space which grew as it was joined by many other students who did not want to chose one camp over the other. These early actions were the backbone of her philosophy of inter-religious co-operation and subsequent peace work. She was convinced that working towards positive relations between different groups and faiths is crucial in order to achieve durable peace.<br /><br /><b>Starting a grassroots peace initiative: The Wajir Peace Comittee</b><br />Wajir is one of the Northern Kenyan districts that was under emergency law from 1963 to 1990, with government forces fighting an active guerrilla movement (the Shifta war). When the emergency and quasi-occupation ended, the security situation deteriorated even more. There was an open conflict which claimed 1500 lives, and which resulted in a lot of hatred between different clans. In 1992, Dekha and other women as well as concerned men started a grassroots peace initiative, bringing together people from all clans. Despite opposition from the traditional clan leaders (elder men), they began to organise mediation between the warring parties (with representatives of minority groups acting as moderators). When an agreement was in place, they set up the Wajir Peace Committee, with representatives of all parties - clans, Government security organs, Parliamentarians, civil servants, Muslim and Christian religious leaders, NGOs etc. - to implement the agreement. Dekha, who had been working as coordinator for a mobile primary health care project for nomadic people, was elected as Secretary of the Peace committee hence undertaking dual roles. <br /><br /><br /><b>Reaching out</b><br /><br />The model developed in Wajir, which Dekha described as &quot;a peace and development committee - a structure for responding to conflict at a local level&quot;, was used again in 1998, when the Christian community in Wajir experienced some violence. Dekha assisted in the formation of a disaster committee of Muslim women to assist and make amends with the Christian community. They held prayer meetings with Muslim and Christian women, in which both shared their experience and thereby strengthened their relationship. Subsequently the Wajir Peace Committee began to include Christian women, leading to the formation of an inter-faith committee for peace which has undertaken further activities to intervene in religious conflicts. <br /><br />Fostering inter-faith dialogue and attempting to resolve tensions and conflict between religions had been a central focus of Dekha's activity since her first involvement in working for peace, and her methods have now been copied not only elsewhere in Kenya, but in Uganda, Ethiopia, Sudan, and South Africa. In addition, Dekha has taught in Somalia, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Canada, Cambodia, Philippines, Ghana, Nigeria, Netherlands, Zimbabwe, and the UK.<br /><br />In 1996-97 Dekha was team leader for the Community Development training programme of the Arid Lands Resource Management Project in Kenya. She has written extensively and was the Organising Board Member of Nomadic and Pastoralists Development Initiative, a Kenyan rural development initiative. Also in 1997 she was a founding member of the regional Coalition of Peace in Africa (COPA). As East African Regional Coordinator, she was involved in the Linking Peace Practice to Policy (LPP) programme of the COPA, funded by Comic Relief in the UK. LPP seeks to support and link communities in volatile areas in conflict prevention and peace-building work. Dekha also, in 1998, became Training and Learning Co-ordinator of Responding to Conflict (RTC) which engages in conflict transformation: planning, organizing and facilitating a range of conflict resolution training programmes. She was also a Board Member of Co-existence International, an initiative committed to strengthening the field of policymakers, practitioners, researchers, advocates, organizations and networks promoting co-existence. Dekha was a founding Member of a Global Peace Practitioners Network ACTION for conflict transformation and since September 2000, had been a member of a consortium of African and international conflict transformation specialists working together on development of a series of intensive, participatory workshops for the United Nations Department for Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA). UNDESA assists governments and civil society partners in sub-Saharan Africa to strengthen their capacities for anticipating, containing and managing conflict situations. Since 2002 Dekha had also been a patron of the London-based NGO Peace Direct. She worked towards inter-religious/ethnic co-operation in this capacity through co-facilitating a project which aimed to provide a platform for young Muslims from all UK backgrounds, after the London bombings, to explore issues and challenges around being a Muslim and British in current UK society. Dekha was a Member of the International Advisory Board of the University of Ulster, INCORE London-Derry, North Ireland. She was a Board Member of the Berghof Center in Germany.<br /><br />Dekha last lived in Mombasa and worked on peace, conflict and development issues with a number of organisations. She raised funds to support community groups in peace-building and communication infrastructure and continued to work for the Wajir community with young people to create economic development. She supported Peace Practitioners through mentoring and coaching in order to create a second generation of peace workers in Kenya and on the Horn of Africa.<br /><br />In Mombasa she has supported the setting up of the Oasis of Peace Centre, helping the local communities in Kikambala to do some basic mediation, and she worked as an advisor to the Kenyan government for mediation work in different parts of the country. <br /><br />In 1999 Dekha was awarded the Distinguished Medal for Service by the District Commissioner for Wajir on behalf of the Kenyan Government, and in 2005 was named Kenyan Peace Builder of the Year. She was also nominated as one among 1000 women for the Nobel Prize in 2005, now known as 1000 Peace women across the globe, and received the 2009 Hessian Peace Prize (Germany).<br /><br /><b><br />Qu'ran's teaching as background</b><br />Dekha's religious and spiritual identity as a Muslim formed a strong foundation for her peace work. Her religious beliefs informed her vision of how peace is to be achieved. She referred to and explored the Qu'ran's teaching on understanding the soul in the context of outlining what is necessary for bringing about a sincere and durable peace. Indeed, Dekha encouraged individuals and communities affected by conflict to critically analyse themselves using verses from the Qu'ran, which she stated would enable them to build their conflict transformation on a religious and spiritual base. <br /><br /><b><br />Dekha's principles for comprehensive peace building</b><br />Dekha defined a set of principles that summarise her experience of comprehensive peace building, linking peace theory and policy with pragmatic action¸ and private lobbying/advocacy with public mobilisation. Sometimes she expressed this through the acronym AFRICA: Analysis, Flexibility, Responsiveness, Innovation, Context- specific and awareness, and Action/learning-orientation.\\r\\nDekha Ibrahim Abdi passed away on July 14th, 2011, after a severe car accident.",

				"biography": "José Antonio Abreu was born in Venezuela in 1939. His education pursued two tracks: he obtained a Ph.D. in petroleum economics in 1961, and in 1964 graduated as a composer and organist from Venezuela's national conservatory of music. By 1969 he was a Professor of Economics and Professor of Planning at different universities, and was also a Deputy in the Venezuelan Congress. In 1975 he began the work for which he has been awarded, founding the Symphony Orchestra Simon Bolivar and the National Symphony Youth Orchestra (NSYO).<b><br /></b><br />The success of the NSYO under Abreu's direction led to the establishment of youth orchestras in other Venezuelan States, which has grown into the National System of Children and Youth Orchestras of Venezuela, under the auspices of a State Foundation, FESNOJIV. This now involves 110,000 Venezuelans, grouped in 120 youth orchestras, 60 children's orchestras and a network of choirs, with musical training starting from the age of two. The orchestras are based on 75 'orchestral cells' around the country, each with at least one orchestra, and the System also includes workshops in which children learn to build and repair instruments, special programmes for children with disabilities or learning difficulties, and specialist centres or institutes for phonology, audiovisuals and higher musical education.<br /><br />Perhaps the most remarkable element about this orchestral System is that it is explicitly oriented towards lower-income social strata. It has been described as &quot;a social movement of massive dimensions, that works using music as the instrument that makes the social integration of different Venezuelan population groups possible and supports the strata with low income.&quot; The orchestras have had a substantial social impact in the communities in which they are active, legitimising and promoting music throughout the community and leading to something of a musical and cultural renaissance. Studies have also shown that the young people involved in the orchestras also perform better in other areas of academic and social life.<br /><br />This unique programme of musical education and awakening has attracted much international notice and acclaim. UNESCO awarded FESNOJIV its <br />International Music Award in 1993-94 and in 1998 UNDP commended it as an outstanding example of poverty reduction. Inspired by this example similar initiatives have been started in other Latin American and Caribbean countries. The Venezuelan National Symphony Children's Orchestra also excited much admiration in Europe in 1998, with a tour through France and Italy, and again in 2000, when it played in many celebrated venues in Germany.<br /><br />FESNOJIV is a substantial organisation with nearly 1,000 staff spread through the 75 'orchestral cells'. Abreu has been the Director of the Foundation since its establishment in 1994, before which he was for five years Venezuela's Minister for Culture and President of its National Council for Culture. In 1998 he received UNESCO's title 'Ambassador for Peace'. He his also a recipient of several awards, among them more recently the 2008 Prince of Asturias Arts Award, the 2009 Polar Music Prize, the Légion d'honneur of France and the Peace Prize of Seoul, Korea, in 2010. He received honorary degrees of the Metropolitana University, Caracas, in 2010, and from Carleton University, Canada, in 2012.<br /><br /><i>(Last update: February 2013)</i>",

				"lastname": "Agnivesh",
				"biography": "Swami Agnivesh was born as Vepa Shyam Rao on 21st September 1939, the grandson of the Diwan (Chief Minister) of a princely state called Shakti, now in Chattisgarh. He gained law and business management degrees, became a lecturer in Calcutta and for a while also practised law. He comes from an orthodox Hindu family, but in 1968 he became a full-time worker of the Arya Samaj, a Hindu reformist movement, and two years later became a sanyasi, renouncing worldly possessions and becoming, in the process, Swami Agnivesh.<br /><br />On the same date that he became a &quot;renouncer&quot;, Agnivesh co-founded a political party, the Arya Sabha, to work for political order, founded on Arya Samaj principles. The principles were spelt out in a book published in 1974, <i>Vaidik Samajvad</i> (Vedic Socialism). This rejects the lopsided materialism of both capitalism and communism in favour of what the Arya Sabha constitution calls &quot;social spirituality&quot;.<br /><br />When Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in 1975, cracking down on opposition parties, Agnivesh and some colleagues were arrested. He was in jail for 14 months. After the 1977 elections which swept Indira Gandhi from office, Agnivesh was elected to the Haryana state legislative assembly, becoming education minister. He rapidly became disillusioned, resigned and decided to devote all his energy and time to social justice movements.<br /><br />During this period he began to denounce bonded labour, a cause for which he became well known. He founded the Bandhua Mukti Morcha (BMM, the Bonded Labour Liberation Front) in 1981, and is still its Chairperson. Swami Agnivesh puts the number of child labourers in India (despite constitutional provisions) at 65 million. Some are in debt bondage or have been pledged by parents in return for financial advances; some are lured by procurers who promise bright prospects after training. BMM has secured the release of more than 172,000 Indian workers, and has helped create a number of trade unions, including the All India Brick Kiln Workers, the Stone Quarry Workers and the Construction Workers. Working also at the international level, Agnivesh has also thrice been elected as Chairperson of the UN Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery.<br /><br />Agnivesh has had a high profile with a number of social issues apart from child and bonded labour:<br /><br />In 1987 he led a 18 day long 'padyatra' (march on foot) from Delhi to Deorala in Rajasthan to protest against sati (the immolation of widows on their husband's funeral pyres) following a particularly notorious incident. The march was stopped, and Agnivesh briefly gaoled, but both received widespread, sympathetic coverage. The Indian Parliament later enacted the Sati Prevention Act. Back in Delhi Agnivesh launched a campaign against female foeticide, which also resulted in legislation.<br /><br />In 1988/89 he led a movement to secure the entry of 'untouchables' into Hindu temples which were discriminating against them. Again he was arrested but the action had a substantial impact on public opinion.<br /><br />In 1989 he led a multi-religious march from Delhi to Meerat to protest against and defuse communal violence that had claimed the lives of 45 Muslim youths. Dr. Asghar Ali Engineer was also a prominent participant in the march.<br /><br />From 1989-95, he participated in a number of people's movements (including Narmada Bachao Andolan) in respect of land, water, forests and fisheries issues, and campaigned with women's movements against alcohol in both Andhra Pradesh and Haryana, winning total prohibition (for a short period) in both states.<br /><br />In 1999, concerned about escalating religious fundamentalism and obscurantism, he helped to launch a multi-religious forum called Religions for Social Justice, which led a group of 55 religious leaders to the place where an Australian Christian missionary and his two sons had been burned to death in their sleep by Hindu religious fanatics. The leaders in The Times of India on the theme of religious tolerance and reconciliation, written by Agnivesh, attest to the impact of this initiative. For many years he has also written articles in leading newspapers jointly with a Christian priest, Rev. Valson Thampu.<br /><br />For many years, Agnivesh has deplored in newspaper articles the consumerism and materialism that he perceives to be undermining Indian culture. In 1997, the Arya Samaj movement launched a people's movement against the 'western cultural invasion' and the 'neo-colonialism' of the WTO and World Bank.<br /><br />Four years later, Agnivesh led a protest march from Mumbai to Gujarat against economic globalisation.<br /><br />In 2002 happened the massacre in Gujarat, which disturbed Swami Agnivesh deeply. He once again organized a group of 72 eminent religious-social leaders who spent five days in the violence affected areas of Gujarat and denounced the Hindu fundamentalist organizations and sectors responsible.\\r\\nIn 2004, Agnivesh became the president of the World Council of Arya Samaj.",

				"firstname": "Martín",
				"lastname": "Almada",
				"biography": "Martín Almada was born in 1937 to a poor family in the Chaco Region of Paraguay. Although obliged to work from an early age, he completed a law degree in 1968 and a doctoral degree in educational science in 1972.<br /><br />Together with his first wife, Professor Celestina Perez de Almada, he founded the Instituto 'Juan Baptista Alberdi' in his home town of San Lorenzo. This became an important institution of conscientisation and cooperative development, which was violently suppressed under the dictatorship of General Stroessner in 1974. This was also the year in which Almada finished his doctoral thesis, <i>Paraguay, Education and Dependency,</i> for which he was branded an 'intellectual terrorist' by the authorities. He spent three years in a concentration camp, where he was regularly tortured. During this time his wife died (Almada says 'psychologically murdered' by the police). He was released in 1977, following a sustained campaign by Amnesty International and went into exile, with his mother and three children. He wrote his book, <i>Paraguay: la Carcel Olvidada, el Pais Exiliado,</i> about his experiences in prison, which was published in 1978, having an enormous impact in international human rights circles. In 1986 he published a book of poems, largely written in prison. He joined UNESCO in Paris, working in the environmental education division where he had responsibility for rural development projects in Africa and Latin America.<br /><br />During his exile he campaigned relentlessly on human rights issues. After the fall of the Argentinean Junta following the Falklands War, he made several visits to Argentina to speak about human rights and his educational theories. When in 1989 Stroessner was overthrown, he immediately returned to Paraguay and began to play a leading role in the new human rights movement there, and in the transition to democracy. An early focus of his activities was to seek to bring the torturers to justice and get compensation for the victims, and he filed an action in the courts against Stroessner and his accomplices for the murder of his wife, his wrongful imprisonment and the confiscation of his goods. In 1991 he also published his book <i>Paraguay: Proyecto National</i>, as a contribution towards the foundation of a new constitution.<br /><br />In 1992 he left his job in UNESCO and returned definitively to Paraguay. His major concern at this time was to secure the release into the public domain of the papers of the dictatorship concerning repression and torture, which the police were denying existed. The breakthrough came when the archive was actually discovered by Almada and a judge ordered that it should be made public.<br /><br />This 'Archives of Terror' has proved the most important collection of documents of state terror ever recovered. It is important not just for Paraguay but for the whole of Latin America and, indeed, for the world. In the Archive Almada found his file, detailing his imprisonment and torture, which the Paraguayan Government had always denied. Within a week he had convened a national commission to protect the Archive. Within a month the government had ratified a convention that had been passed by the Congreso National two years before. Further archives were found (some buried) in police stations.<br /><br />However, the government continued to drag its feet over the bringing of human rights violators to justice. In 1994 Almada set up the Paraguayan branch of the American Association of Jurists and began to organise a series of Tribunals against the leading criminals, starting with General Ramon Duarte Vera, who had been Stroessner's Chief of Police and who was considered the regime's chief torturer. Duarte was then living comfortably as Paraguay's ambassador to Bolivia. After hearing many witnesses of torture and assassination, the Tribunal convicted him - and though this judgment had no legal force, the evidence was so overwhelming that he was subsequently recalled by the government, put on trial and sentenced to 16 years in prison. In 1996 Almada was the prime mover in the establishment of a Centre for the Rehabilitation of Torture Victims in collaboration with the International Centre in Denmark (which received a Right Livelihood Award in 1988).<br /><br />This activity in the human rights area was by no means the only application of Almada's formidable energy. Immediately on his return to Paraguay he had set up, with his second wife, Maria Stella Caceres, the Fundación Celestina Perez de Almada, in memory of his first wife. The aim of this foundation was &quot;to struggle against poverty and for the protection of the environment&quot;, and its principal programme, UNIBANCOOP, has four areas of work: Economy and Solidarity, Environmentally Appropriate Science and Technology, Alternative Education and Human Rights. The human rights division has occupied most of the foundation's time, but the other dimensions have always been present and are now coming more to the fore.<br /><br />Almada put at the disposal of his foundation much of his savings from his years working for UNESCO, and used some of his contacts to set up a joint project with a French and African NGO. The education work is carried out through two projects: one on literacy through a national network which was set up by the foundation and a project of Education with Production in Rural Areas. The technology and environment project work is carried out through a project for the use of solar energy for alternative development and has so far focused on the use of parabolic mirrors for solar cooking.<br /><br />External sources of funds for the foundation's annual budget of about USD 70,000 have so far included UNESCO and foundations in Norway, Canada, Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany.<br /><br />Almada has received a number of national awards, including 'Man of the Year, 1992' from the National Television, and the Human Rights Prize in 1997 from the French Government, in recognition of his discovery of the Archives of Terror.",

				"biography": "In 1965 Communist guerrillas first established a presence in the Carare region of Colombia. In 1973, when the army came to evict the guerrillas, the opposing armed groups inflicted dreadful violence on the peasants, and in the 1980s this was exacerbated by the presence of paramilitary groups.<br /><br />By 1987 over 500 peasants had been killed and, in a fateful meeting with military and paramilitary leaders, the peasants were given four options: side with the military, side with the guerrillas, leave the region or die. Those peasants who had sought to stay independent of the violence chose a fifth option: to organise non-violently for peace and development. And so the ATCC was born, with the slogan 'for the right to life, peace and work'.<br /><br />ATCC's tactics were simple: constant dialogue with all parties (military, paramilitary, guerrillas, government) and an unshakeable commitment to non-violence. They were startlingly successful and only five killings occurred in the region from May 1987 to February 1990, when violence was at a peak for Colombia as a whole. ATCC's peace rally in 1987 attracted 8,000 peasants - two-thirds of all those in the region. In the same year, recognising that peace could not be achieved merely by halting political violence, the Association obtained loans to buy two boats and a grocery store. The shop proved highly successful and was soon providing ATCC with almost its only income.<br /><br />In 1988 the Association presented its Development Plan to the government, emphasising education, communications systems including roads, peasant and communal organisation and the maintenance of natural resources. This soon began to attract investment from the government's National Plan for Rehabilitation.<br /><br />Signs of a resurgence of guerrilla activity in 1989 led the ATCC to focus its efforts once again on peace-making. A Peace Forum was organised, bringing together all the protagonists as well as local organisations. Only a month later, however, three of ATCC's leading activists - including its chief spokesmen Miguel Barajas and José Vargas Mateus - were gunned down in their home town of Cimitarra.<br /><br />The Association immediately called a General Assembly, elected a new Board and determined to pursue dialogue with the armed groups as well as its development projects. <br /><br />Courage in adversity has been the hallmark of the ATCC.",

She later became Pierre Trudeau's advisor on women's issues when he was Prime Minister in 1983-84. \\r\\nIn 1985, she founded the Council of Canadians, Canada's largest citizens' advocacy organization, which works to safeguard Canada's universal social security system and its water and energy heritage, where she has served as the elected chairperson since 1988. The Council of Canadians has also been a leading voice in the international search for a more just and sustainable trade system and, through its Blue Planet Project, fights for the universal right to water. \\r\\nBarlow is the author or co-author of 16 books on all aspects of globalisation and the theft of the &quot;global commons&quot;, the latest being <i>Blue Covenant: The Global Water Crisis and the Coming Battle for the Right to Water</i>.<br /><br />Maude Barlow also chairs the board of Washington-based Food and Water Watch; is on the executive of the San-Francisco-based International Forum on Globalization; and is a Councillor with the Hamburg-based World Future Council. She is the recipient of eleven honorary doctorates and many awards, including the 2005 Lannon Cultural Freedom Fellowship, the 2008 Canadian Environmental Award, the 2009 Earth Day Canada Outstanding Environmental Achievement Award and the 2011 EarthCare Award. From October 2008-2009 Maude Barlow served as Senior Advisor on Water to the 63rd President of the United Nations General Assembly.<br /><br />Together, Maude Barlow and Tony Clarke played a key role in building opposition to, and defeating, the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI), and in campaigning against the World Trade Organisation (WTO)'s free-trade agenda, especially at Seattle (1999) and Cancun (2003). With their working lives closely connected for many years, Barlow and Clarke are now recognized as two of the most respected citizen leaders in Canada and in the global justice movement generally. \\r\\nBoth have been featured speakers at the World Social Forums in Porto Alegre and Mumbai. They have also been important innovators in cross-border organising, shown in their work against the MAI and WTO; in creating democratic models of organising, shown by the Council of Canadians, and in bringing new issues to the forefront of the movement, as with NAFTA, the MAI and water; and in developing credible alternatives, which are discussed in their joint book <i>Global Showdown: How the New Activists are Fighting Global Corporate Rule (2001)</i>. \\r\\nThey have also worked closely together through the International Forum on Globalisation (IFG) which was set up in 1998. A major common focus of their work in recent years has been the world's water resources. In 2002 they published <i>Blue Gold: the Battle Against Corporate Theft of the World's Water</i>, which has been published in 47 countries. A recent book by Clarke, <i>Inside the Bottle</i>: <i>Exposing the Bottled Water Industry</i> (2007) highlights concerns about the bottled water industry and its impact on the water resources of the poor. They have built a considerable network of activists in the South, and an important part of their work has been visiting and assisting communities struggling for water rights, e.g. the village of Plachimada in Kerala fighting against a Coca-Cola plant. <br /><br />One particular victory for the international water movement was the inclusion by referendum into the constitution of Uruguay a new article ensuring not only that access to piped water and sanitation is a fundamental human right available to everyone, but also that in the creation of water policies social and ecological considerations take precedence over economic considerations. \\r\\nBarlow was also deeply involved with an international campaign for a United Nations Convention on the Right to Water. On July 28, 2010, the United Nations General Assembly voted in favour of recognizing water and sanitation as human rights. The resolution - put forward by Bolivia and co-sponsored by 35 states - passed with 122 states voting in favour and 41 abstaining.",

				"biography": "<b>Nnimmo Bassey's indefatigable work with national and international organisations has turned him into one of Africa's leading advocates and campaigners for the environment and human rights. Bassey has stood up against the practices of multinational corporations in his country and the environmental devastation they leave behind destroying the lives and ignoring the rights of the local population.</b><br /><br /><br /><b><br />Environmental Rights Action / Friends of the Earth Nigeria</b><br /><br />Nnimmo Bassey was born on 11 June 1958. He qualified as an architect and practiced in the public sector for ten years. He became active on human rights issues in the 1980s as a member of the Board of Directors of Nigeria's Civil Liberties Organisation. In 1993, he co-founded Environmental Rights Action (ERA), a Nigerian advocacy NGO, to deal with environmental human rights issues in the country. Bassey was ERA's Executive Director for two decades and still is the chair of its Management Board.<br /><br />Environmental Rights Action is also known as Friends of the Earth Nigeria and is the national chapter of Friends of the Earth International (FOEI), the world's largest grassroots environmental network. From 2008-2012, Bassey served as chair of Friends of the Earth International.<br /><br />Bassey's and Environmental Rights Action's major campaigning focus is oil, and the enormous damage being caused to Nigerian communities and other countries in the region (Angola, Cameroon, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and Sudan), where oil is produced. He also works on supporting a broad movement across sub-tropical African countries where new finds of oil are being made. <br /><br /><br /><b>Oil spills &amp; gas flaring in the Niger Delta </b><br /><br />It has been estimated that spills equivalent to the size of that from the Exxon Valdez have occurred in the Niger Delta every year over the past 50 years. Bassey says that there are at least 300 (major and minor) spills every year. The Nigerian Government has established that there were more than 3200 spills between 2006 and 2010. Many have not been cleared up; few lead to compensation payments. Life expectancy in the Niger Delta is 41 years, compared to 48 years nationally in Nigeria. <br /><br />Shell claims that 98% of its spills are caused by theft, vandalism or sabotage by militants and that it is &quot;committed to cleaning up any spill as fast as possible as soon as and for whatever reason it occurs&quot;. Environmental Rights Action and the local communities blame rusting pipes and other deteriorating infrastructure and say that companies are often slow to respond. Convinced that the costs of the oil production are far greater than its benefits, Bassey demands that we &quot;leave the oil in the soil&quot;. <br /><br />Environmental Rights Action has led lawsuits against oil companies on behalf of many communities in Nigeria for liability for damage to their people and environment. <br /><br />Since 1996, Bassey and Environmental Rights Action have led Oilwatch Africa and since 2006 have also led the global South network, Oilwatch International, through which they seek to mobilize communities in Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Congo (Brazzaville), Ghana, and Uganda as well as South America and South East Asia to resist destructive oil and gas extraction activities. Today, Bassey coordinates Oilwatch International.<br /><br />In addition to its work on oil spills, Environmental Rights Action has campaigned against gas flaring, winning a landmark ruling by a Nigerian High Court in 2005 stating that gas flaring is unconstitutional, damages people and the environment, and must stop.<br /><br /><u><br /></u><b>GMOs, biofuels and food sovereignty</b><br /><br />The other major area of Environmental Rights Action's work is GMOs (genetically modified organisms), agrofuels and food sovereignty. Friends of the Earth organisations in Africa created a regional campaign in this area in 2004 and Bassey worked as an international campaigner on GMO issues from 2004-2008. In 2009, field-testing of genetically modified cassava was introduced in Nigeria, and Bassey sees a big risk that African agriculture will be contaminated by GMOs. <br /><br /><br /><b>Further activities &amp; outreach</b><br /><br />In Nigeria, Environmental Rights Action trains people on environmental monitoring and gives legal support to communities affected by environmental damage. Bassey has been directly involved in community monitoring as well as media training for Nigerian journalists. In addition, Environmental Rights Action under Bassey's oversight hosted the secretariat of the Africa Tobacco Control Regional Initiative and coordinated the Nigerian Tobacco Control Alliance. In 2013, Bassey started dedicating more time to grow a new think-tank and advocacy organisation called Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF).<br /><br />In 1998, Environmental Rights Action won the Sophie Prize for its work on environmental justice, and in 2009 the Bloomberg Award for tobacco control activism. Bassey was named by TIME magazine as a 2009 &quot;Hero of the Environment&quot;. He writes poetry as well as of campaigning and research documents. One of Bassey's books is entitled <i>Knee Deep in Crude</i> (2009). In 2012 Nnimmo Bassey was awarded the Rafto Human Rights Prize.<br /><i><br />(Last update: March 2013)</i>",

				"biography": "Walden Bello is one of the leading critics of the current model of economic globalisation, combining the roles of intellectual and activist. As a human rights and peace campaigner, academic, environmentalist and journalist, and through a combination of courage as a dissident, with an extraordinary breadth of published output and personal charisma, he has made a major contribution to the international case against corporate-driven globalisation.<br /><br />Bello was born in Manila in the Philippines in 1945. He was studying in Princeton for a sociology Ph.D. in 1972 when Ferdinand Marcos took power, and plunged into political activism, collecting his Ph.D, but not returning to the university for another 20 years. Over the next two decades, he became a key figure in the international movement to restore democracy in the Philippines, co-ordinating the Anti-Martial Law Coalition and establishing the Philippines Human Rights Lobby in Washington.<br /><br />He was arrested repeatedly and finally jailed by the US authorities in 1978 for leading the non-violent takeover of the Philippine consulate in San Francisco. He was released a week later after a hunger strike to publicise human rights abuses in his home country.<br /><br />While campaigning on human rights he saw how the World Bank and IMF loans and grants were supporting the Marcos regime in power. To expose their role, he took the risk of breaking into the World Bank headquarters in Washington, and brought out 3,000 pages of confidential documents. These provided the material for his book Development Debacle (1982), which became an underground bestseller in the Philippines and contributed to expanding the citizen's movement that eventually deposed Marcos in 1986.<br /><br />After the fall of Marcos, Bello joined the NGO Food First in the USA, and began to expand his coverage of the Bretton Woods institutions, in particular studying the 'newly industrialised countries' of Asia. His critique of the Asian economic 'miracle', Dragons in Distress, was written six years before the financial collapse that swept through the region.<br /><br />His recent work has been criticising the financial subjugation of developing countries and promoting alternative models of development that would make countries less dependent on foreign capital.<br /><br />In 1995, he was co-founder of Focus on the Global South, of which he is now executive director. Focus seeks to build grassroots capacity to tackle wider regional issues of development and capital flows. When the Asian Financial Crisis struck two years later, Focus played a major role advocating a different way forward.<br /><br />Bello argues that &quot;what developing countries and international civil society should aim at is not to reform the WTO but, through a combination of passive and active measures, to radically reduce its power and make it simply another international institution co-existing with and being checked by other international organisations, agreements and regional groupings. It is in such a more fluid, less structured, more pluralistic world with multiple checks and balances that the nations and communities of the South will be able to carve out the space to develop based on their values, their rhythms, and the strategies of their choice.&quot;<br /><br />At the abortive WTO meeting in Seattle in 1999, Bello played a leading role in the teach-ins around the protest events and was later beaten up by the Seattle police. He was detained again by the Italian police and nearly run over by a police car at the 2001 G-8 summit in Genoa. He also played a key role in civil society circles in elaborating the strategy to derail the WTO Ministerial in Cancun in September 2003.<br /><br />He has also played a leading role as an environmentalist, and is former chairman of the board of Greenpeace Southeast Asia. His 1998 book A Siamese Tragedy, documenting the environmental destruction of Thailand, became a bestseller there and won praise from former Thai Prime Minister Anand Oanyarachun. It received the Chancellor's Award for best book from the University of the Philippines in 2000.<br /><br />Bello has campaigned for years for the withdrawal of US military bases in the Philippines, Okinawa and Korea, and has helped set up several regional coalitions dedicated to denuclearisation and demilitarisation, and a new kind of security plan based on meeting people's needs.<br /><br />After September 11 2001, he was a leading voice from the South urging the USA not to resort to military intervention - which he believed would exacerbate the problem - but to tackle the root causes of terrorism in poverty, inequality, injustice and oppression. In March 2002, he led the peace mission to the southern Philippine island of Basilan, where the US army recently sent their special forces. He was also one of the leaders of a peace mission of Asian parliamentarians and civil society activists that visited Baghdad in March 2003 in a last-ditch effort to stop the US invasion of Iraq.<br /><br />Bello's current and immediate past roles include:\\r\\n<ul><li>National Chair Emeritus and National Chair of the party Akbayan, one of the fastest growing parties in the Philippines, which has two members in the National Assembly.</li><li>Professor of sociology and public administration at the University of the Philippines.</li><li>Executive director of Focus on the Global South.</li><li>Member and former Chair of the board of Greenpeace South East Asia.</li><li>Visiting Professor in Southeast Asian Studies at the University of California at Los Angeles.</li><li>Board member of Food First, the International Forum on Globalisation, and the Transnational Institute.</li></ul>\\r\\n<br />Bello has won praise for his writing, as the author or editor of 11 books on Asian issues and a range of articles, notably American Lake: The nuclear peril in the Pacific (1984) (co-authored with Peter Hayes and Lyuba Zarsky), People and Power in the Pacific (1992), Dark Victory: The United States and Global Poverty (1999), Global Finance: Thinking on regulating speculative capital markets (2000) and The Future in the Balance: Essays on globalisation and resistance (2001). He won the New California Media Award for Best International Reporting in 1998. The Belgian newspaper Le Soir recently called Bello &quot;the most respected anti-globalisation thinker in Asia&quot;.
